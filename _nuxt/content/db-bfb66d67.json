Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable.\n\nPersonally, Vue is the _easiest_ frontend framework / library to learn.\n\nVue uses __declarative rendering__, this means that it can render data to the DOM using _standard_ HTML template syntax such as;\n\n```html\n<div id=\"block\">\n  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>\n</div>\n```\n\nUsing Vue you can create links between the data and the DOM for example if we have a `prop` or a variable in our `<script></script>` tag and this is updated the DOM will react and update to match the new data.\n\n---\n\n## Directives\n\nVue uses html `attributes` known as __directives__ `e.g. 'v-on'`. Directives can attach event listeners that invoke methods in our instances. See example below;\n\n```html\n<div id=\"event-handler\">\n  <h2>Welcome</h2>\n  <button v-on:click=\"doSomething\">Click me</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe above snippet tells Vue to run the method `doSomething` when the button is clicked. The method is declared in the `<script></script>` tags under `methods` or more recently using the Vue composition API's `setup` method.\n\nThere is more directives than `v-on`, for example you can also use `v-model` to bind data to an DOM element or use `v-if` to conditionally render an element. There is a lot more too what you can find scattered around the [Vue Website](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/).\n\nOn top of the existing directives you can also create your own custom directives.

Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable.\n\nPersonally, Vue is the _easiest_ frontend framework / library to learn.\n\nVue uses __declarative rendering__, this means that it can render data to the DOM using _standard_ HTML template syntax such as;\n\n```html\n<div id=\"block\">\n  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>\n</div>\n```\n\nUsing Vue you can create links between the data and the DOM for example if we have a `prop` or a variable in our `<script></script>` tag and this is updated the DOM will react and update to match the new data.\n\n---\n\n## Directives\n\nVue uses html `attributes` known as __directives__ `e.g. 'v-on'`. Directives can attach event listeners that invoke methods in our instances. See example below;\n\n```html\n<div id=\"event-handler\">\n  <h2>Welcome</h2>\n  <button v-on:click=\"doSomething\">Click me</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe above snippet tells Vue to run the method `doSomething` when the button is clicked. The method is declared in the `<script></script>` tags under `methods` or more recently using the Vue composition API's `setup` method.\n\nThere is more directives than `v-on`, for example you can also use `v-model` to bind data to an DOM element or use `v-if` to conditionally render an element. There is a lot more too what you can find scattered around the [Vue Website](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/).\n\nOn top of the existing directives you can also create your own custom directives.

There is a lot more too what you can find scattered around the [Vue Website](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/).\n\nOn top of the existing directives you can also create your own custom directives. [Find out more here](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/custom-directive.html#intro).\n\n## Directives No 3\n\nVue uses html `attributes` known as __directives__ `e.g. 'v-on'`. Directives can attach event listeners that invoke methods in our instances. See example below;\n\n```html\n<div id=\"event-handler\">\n  <h2>Welcome</h2>\n  <button v-on:click=\"doSomething\">Click me</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe above snippet tells Vue to run the method `doSomething` when the button is clicked.

Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable.\n\nPersonally, Vue is the _easiest_ frontend framework / library to learn.\n\nVue uses __declarative rendering__, this means that it can render data to the DOM using _standard_ HTML template syntax such as;\n\n```html\n<div id=\"block\">\n  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>\n</div>\n```\n\nUsing Vue you can create links between the data and the DOM for example if we have a `prop` or a variable in our `<script></script>` tag and this is updated the DOM will react and update to match the new data.\n\n---\n\n## Directives\n\nVue uses html `attributes` known as __directives__ `e.g. 'v-on'`. Directives can attach event listeners that invoke methods in our instances. See example below;\n\n```html\n<div id=\"event-handler\">\n  <h2>Welcome</h2>\n  <button v-on:click=\"doSomething\">Click me</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe above snippet tells Vue to run the method `doSomething` when the button is clicked. The method is declared in the `<script></script>` tags under `methods` or more recently using the Vue composition API's `setup` method.\n\nThere is more directives than `v-on`, for example you can also use `v-model` to bind data to an DOM element or use `v-if` to conditionally render an element. There is a lot more too what you can find scattered around the [Vue Website](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/).\n\nOn top of the existing directives you can also create your own custom directives.

Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable.\n\nPersonally, Vue is the _easiest_ frontend framework / library to learn.\n\nVue uses __declarative rendering__, this means that it can render data to the DOM using _standard_ HTML template syntax such as;\n\n```html\n<div id=\"block\">\n  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>\n</div>\n```\n\nUsing Vue you can create links between the data and the DOM for example if we have a `prop` or a variable in our `<script></script>` tag and this is updated the DOM will react and update to match the new data.\n\n---\n\n## Directives\n\nVue uses html `attributes` known as __directives__ `e.g. 'v-on'`. Directives can attach event listeners that invoke methods in our instances. See example below;\n\n```html\n<div id=\"event-handler\">\n  <h2>Welcome</h2>\n  <button v-on:click=\"doSomething\">Click me</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe above snippet tells Vue to run the method `doSomething` when the button is clicked. The method is declared in the `<script></script>` tags under `methods` or more recently using the Vue composition API's `setup` method.\n\nThere is more directives than `v-on`, for example you can also use `v-model` to bind data to an DOM element or use `v-if` to conditionally render an element. There is a lot more too what you can find scattered around the [Vue Website](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/).\n\nOn top of the existing directives you can also create your own custom directives.
